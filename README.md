Project: Periarea
Overview:
"Periarea" is a Python-based program designed to calculate the area and perimeter of different geometric shapes such as rectangles, squares, triangles, circles, and more. The program allows users to input the dimensions of the shapes and provides accurate results for both area and perimeter in a user-friendly manner.

Features:

Supports multiple shapes (e.g., rectangle, square, circle, triangle).
Dynamic calculation based on user input.
Error handling for invalid inputs.
Clear and structured output of results.
Potential Uses:

Educational tool for students learning geometry.
Quick calculations for design, engineering, or any field involving shape dimensions.
Fun and interactive project for improving Python skills.
